* Food-Search Platform

  Our platform allows the user to discover new recipes from all over the world to prepare. 

  The user has multiple food-selection criteria to employ: from choosing the most popular dishes, searching unique foods from a respective country, choosing from a variety of dishes that employ a specific ingredient or to randomly select a recipe suggested from the platform.

* Our Added Features

  When you search for a new meal, we not only provide you its name and place of procedence.

  We also provide the required ingredients for its preparation and the cooking instructions.

## The Creation Process

For the ellaboration of Project-Name, the following technologies were employed:

* Local files

  See attached files (html, css & js)

* CSS Framework -> Tailwind

  Tailwind is a unique CSS framework when it comes to styling web applications, meaning that Tailwind does not have a default theme that you have to use like other CSS frameworks.
  With Tailwind’s pre-built classes, you can design the layout directly in an HTML file. This makes it a very responsive, mobile-friendly CSS framework.
